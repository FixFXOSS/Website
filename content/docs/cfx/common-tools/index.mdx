# Common Tools

This section provides detailed documentation for FiveM's built-in tools that help with monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis. These tools are essential for both server owners and developers to maintain and optimize their FiveM servers.

## Available Tools

### Resource Monitor (resmon)
The Resource Monitor is a powerful tool for tracking resource performance and identifying potential issues. It provides real-time metrics about CPU usage, memory consumption, and script execution times.

[Learn more about Resource Monitor →](./resource-monitor)

### Profiler
The Profiler tool helps analyze script performance and identify bottlenecks in your resources. It provides detailed information about function execution times and resource load times.

[Learn more about Profiler →](./profiler)

### Network Tools
Network tools help monitor and diagnose network-related issues in your FiveM server. These tools provide insights into network latency, packet loss, and connection quality.

### Debug Tools
Debug tools provide real-time access to server information and debugging capabilities. They help track resource execution and identify issues in your server environment.

## Getting Started

To use these tools effectively:

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and use the tools
2. Familiarize yourself with the basic commands and configurations
3. Start with monitoring tools to establish baseline performance
4. Use debugging tools when investigating specific issues
5. Document your findings and observations

## Best Practices

- Enable tools only when needed to minimize performance impact
- Use appropriate monitoring intervals based on your needs
- Document findings and observations
- Regularly review monitoring data for patterns
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Test tool configurations in a development environment before applying them to production
