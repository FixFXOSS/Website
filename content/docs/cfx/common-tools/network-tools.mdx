# Network Tools

FiveM provides several tools for monitoring and diagnosing network-related issues. These tools help identify network latency, packet loss, and connection quality problems that can affect server performance and player experience.

## Available Network Tools

### Network Graph (netgraph)
The Network Graph provides real-time visualization of network performance metrics.

#### Enabling Network Graph
Add to your `server.cfg`:
```yaml
# Enable network graph
setr netgraph_enabled 1
setr netgraph_interval 1000  # Update interval in milliseconds
```

#### Accessing Network Graph
In-game command:
```
/netgraph
```

#### Features
- Real-time network latency display
- Packet loss monitoring
- Bandwidth usage tracking
- Connection quality indicators

### Network Statistics
Provides detailed network performance statistics.

#### Accessing Network Stats
In-game command:
```
/netstats
```

#### Metrics Displayed
- Current latency
- Average latency
- Packet loss percentage
- Bandwidth usage
- Connection quality score

## Network Monitoring

### Latency Monitoring
- Tracks round-trip time (RTT)
- Identifies latency spikes
- Shows average and peak latency
- Helps diagnose connection issues

### Packet Loss Tracking
- Monitors dropped packets
- Shows loss percentage
- Identifies patterns of loss
- Helps diagnose network issues

### Bandwidth Usage
- Tracks data transfer rates
- Shows upload and download speeds
- Identifies bandwidth-intensive operations
- Helps optimize network usage

### Connection Quality
- Measures overall connection health
- Identifies potential issues
- Shows stability metrics
- Helps diagnose connection problems

## Interpreting Network Data

### Normal Operation
- Latency should be stable and low
- Packet loss should be minimal
- Bandwidth usage should be consistent
- Connection quality should be high

### Warning Signs
- High or fluctuating latency
- Significant packet loss
- Unusual bandwidth patterns
- Poor connection quality

## Best Practices

### Monitoring
- Enable monitoring during peak hours
- Track baseline performance
- Document network patterns
- Set up alerts for issues

### Optimization
- Optimize network-intensive operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate compression
- Consider bandwidth limits

### Configuration
- Adjust monitoring intervals
- Set appropriate thresholds
- Enable only necessary features
- Consider performance impact

## Common Issues

### High Latency
- Check network infrastructure
- Review server location
- Optimize network code
- Consider connection quality

### Packet Loss
- Check network stability
- Review firewall settings
- Optimize packet handling
- Consider network congestion

### Bandwidth Issues
- Review data transfer patterns
- Optimize resource usage
- Implement proper caching
- Consider bandwidth limits

### Connection Problems
- Check network configuration
- Review firewall rules
- Optimize connection handling
- Consider network stability

## Troubleshooting

### Network Diagnostics
1. Check server network configuration
2. Verify firewall settings
3. Test network connectivity
4. Monitor network performance

### Performance Optimization
1. Review network-intensive code
2. Optimize data transfer
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Monitor network usage

### Configuration Review
1. Verify network settings
2. Check monitoring configuration
3. Review alert thresholds
4. Test network tools
