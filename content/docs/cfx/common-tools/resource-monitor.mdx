# Resource Monitor (resmon)

The Resource Monitor (resmon) is a built-in tool in FiveM that provides real-time monitoring of resource performance. It's essential for identifying performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and other resource-related issues.

## Enabling Resource Monitor

To enable the Resource Monitor, add the following configuration to your `server.cfg`:

```yaml
# Enable resource monitoring
setr resmon_enabled 1
setr resmon_interval 1000  # Update interval in milliseconds
setr resmon_history 60     # Number of samples to keep
```

## Accessing the Monitor

Once enabled, you can access the Resource Monitor in-game using the command:

```
/resmon
```

## Monitor Features

The Resource Monitor provides several key metrics for each resource:

### CPU Usage
- Shows the percentage of CPU time used by each resource
- Helps identify resource-intensive scripts
- Displays both current and average CPU usage

### Memory Consumption
- Tracks memory usage per resource
- Helps identify potential memory leaks
- Shows both current and peak memory usage

### Script Execution Time
- Measures the time taken by scripts to execute
- Helps identify slow-performing scripts
- Displays both current and average execution times

### Network Usage
- Monitors network traffic per resource
- Tracks incoming and outgoing data
- Helps identify network-intensive resources

### Thread Performance
- Shows the number of active threads per resource
- Tracks thread execution times
- Helps identify thread-related issues

## Interpreting the Data

### Normal Operation
- CPU usage should be relatively stable
- Memory usage should not continuously increase
- Script execution times should be consistent
- Network usage should match expected patterns

### Warning Signs
- Continuously increasing memory usage
- Spikes in CPU usage
- Unusually long script execution times
- Unexpected network traffic patterns

## Best Practices

### Monitoring
- Enable monitoring during development and testing
- Use appropriate intervals based on your needs
- Document baseline performance metrics
- Regularly review monitoring data

### Optimization
- Address high CPU usage resources first
- Investigate memory leaks immediately
- Optimize slow-performing scripts
- Monitor network usage for potential issues

### Configuration
- Adjust monitoring intervals based on server load
- Set appropriate history length for your needs
- Enable monitoring only when necessary
- Consider running on a separate monitoring instance

## Common Issues

### High CPU Usage
- Check for infinite loops
- Review resource-intensive operations
- Optimize database queries
- Consider implementing caching

### Memory Leaks
- Review resource cleanup procedures
- Check for unclosed connections
- Monitor object creation and destruction
- Implement proper garbage collection

### Slow Script Execution
- Optimize database operations
- Review event handling
- Check for blocking operations
- Consider implementing async operations
